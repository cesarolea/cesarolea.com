On July 7th 2021 [[https://loanpro.io][LoanPro]] opened its new offices to the world. I was
part of that celebration and was invited to give a speech. To me it
was very exciting, and I saw it as the culmination of 9 years of
building. Not only the software platform, but also a viable software
development operation, a company with a culture where I'd like to
work. It is also the beginning of LoanPro as a big player in the
fintech space. This is just getting started.
