On March 2024 I was honored to be invited, along with my friends and
coworkers Rhett Roberts and Lloyd Roberts, to participate as keynote
speaker at the [[https://www.aftweb.com/about-aft-0][Brandon Dewitt Technology Keynote]] for the Association
for Financial Technology (AFT) spring summit. The opportunity to get
to know many of my peers in the broader fintech industry was a great
experience, and something I hope can be repeated some time in the future.
